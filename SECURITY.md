# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is currently developed on the `main` branch. Security fixes (when applicable) are delivered via normal
releases/merges to `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Best option: use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting for this repository (Security tab → “Report a
vulnerability”). That keeps details out of public search/results while we work on a fix.

If private reporting is not available for you, open a draft pull request with minimal detail and ask maintainers for
a private channel to share reproduction steps.

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue and impact.
- Steps to reproduce (or a proof-of-concept).
- Any logs/screenshots that help validate the issue.
- The environment (Pi OS version, hardware model, and whether MQTT is enabled).

## Response expectations

We’ll acknowledge receipt when we can and work toward a fix. Timelines depend on maintainer availability and
severity.
